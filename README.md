City-Based Compass Tool:

This project calculates the compass bearing and distance between two locations based on coordinates or city names. 
It includes several Python scripts with optional map plotting and Qibla direction features.


How to Run:

Install matplotlib on your IDE
bash "pip install matplotlib"
Make sure worldcities.csv is in a data/ folder if you're using Compassini.py or citybasedmulticoord.py.

Run any file via:

bash "python3 filename.py"

AI & Contributions:
We wrote the main functions ourselves (coordinate handling, city lookups, logic). Some plotting and bearing calculation parts were revised with ChatGPT's help â€” hence the odd comments in a few scripts.

No code was copied from online tutorials. If formulas were used (e.g. Haversine), they were sourced from standard public references.

We got the dataset for major city coordinates from
